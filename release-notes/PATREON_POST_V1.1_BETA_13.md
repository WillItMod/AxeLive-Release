# AxeLive V1.1_BETA_13

## Highlights
- Nano 3 / Nano 3S thermal control is more stable (predictive control using power + learned heatsoak delay).
- Glitch-resistant learning (guards against bad temp/fan telemetry frames that can cause yoyo).
- Updated builds for both Windows (desktop) and Linux (headless).
